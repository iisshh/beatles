    <h1>The Beatles</h1>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles"> Beatles</a> were an English rock band formed in
        Liverpool in 1960. With a line-up comprising <em>Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr,</em>
        they are regarded as the most influential band of all time.

    <p>In March 1957, John Lennon, then aged sixteen, formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High
        School in Liverpool. They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen
        after discovering that another local group was already using the name.[5] Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined
        them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July.[6] In February 1958, McCartney invited his
        friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his
        playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's
        persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the
        instrumental song "Raunchy" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus,[7] and they enlisted him as their lead
        guitarist.[8][9]

        By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool
        College of Art.[10] The three guitarists, billing themselves as Johnny and the Moondogs,[11] were playing rock
        and roll whenever they could find a drummer.[12] Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold
        one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960, and
        it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the
        Crickets.[13][14] They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief
        tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they
        had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August shortened the name to The
        Beatles.[15]</p>
